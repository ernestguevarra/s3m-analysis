# Exercises on performing analysis of Simple Spatial Sampling Method (S3M) data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a template repository for exercises designed to teach and
practice performing analysis of Simple Spatial Sampling Method (S3M)
data. This template repository can be used within a [GitHub
Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) environment.

## Exercises

This repository currently includes the following exercises:

### Exercise 1: Datasets required for an S3M analysis

This exercise describes the datasets needed for an S3M analysis and
reviews basic data structure knowledge relevant to R related to the
types of datasets required for an S3M analysis.

Starter code for this exercises is named `exercise_1_s3m_datasets.R`.
Example datasets for all the exercises can be found in the folder
`data`.

### Exercise 2: Preparing S3M data for analysis

This exercise describes the datasets needed for an S3M analysis in more
detail and reviews data handling and management skills in R related to
the types of datasets required for an S3M analysis.

Starter code for this exercise is named
`exercise_2_preparing_s3m_data.R`.

### Exercise 3: Spatial interpolation

This exercise discusses how to perform spatial interpolation on S3M data
to be able to predict estimates of the indicator of interest in smaller
spatial units across the survey area.

Starter code for this exercise is named
`exercise_3_spatial_interpolation.R`.

### Exercise 4: Aggregated estimates

This exercise discusses how to aggregate S3M data to provide estimates
at much larger spatial units, usually those that follow administrative
boundary lines.

Starter code for this exercise is named
`exercise_4_aggregated_estimates.R`.
